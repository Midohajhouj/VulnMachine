## Kioptrix VM3 Walkthrough by MIDO

This is a step-by-step guide to exploiting and escalating privileges on the Kioptrix VM3 machine. The walkthrough involves enumeration, service scanning, web application exploitation, and privilege escalation.

## Prerequisites:
- Kioptrix VM3 image running on VMware.
- Attacker machine (e.g., Kali Linux).
- Basic knowledge of Linux and penetration testing tools.

## Network Configuration and Target Information
1. Ensure Kioptrix VM3 is running and connected to the same network as your attacking machine.
2. Identify the IP address of Kioptrix VM3:
   - From the attacker machine, run an Nmap scan to discover devices on the network:
 
## Important Tools Used:

   nmap: Network scanning tool.
   Gobuster: Directory brute forcing tool.
   sqlmap: SQL injection automation tool.

Conclusion

The Kioptrix VM3 is a beginner-level penetration testing target that teaches web application exploitation, network scanning, and privilege escalation techniques. Always use a controlled environment for such practices to avoid legal or ethical issues.

This is a basic outline, and the specifics can change depending on the configurations and services available on the machine. Adjust the steps as needed based on your findings during the enumeration phase!
