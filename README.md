Project Overview

The VulnMachine Walkthrough project includes detailed guides for solving vulnerable machines available on VulnHub. Each walkthrough includes information on the tools, techniques, and processes involved in gaining access to the machine, exploiting vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, and cleaning up after a successful compromise.
Prerequisites

Before starting any of the walkthroughs, make sure you have the following setup:

    Virtualization Software: VirtualBox or VMware
    Penetration Testing Distribution: Kali Linux or any similar distribution
    GoatLinux VM: (or any vulnerable VM from VulnHub)
    Wordlists for brute-forcing (e.g., /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt in Kali)
    Networking Tools: Nmap, Netcat, Hydra, etc.

Setup
1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the VulnMachine Walkthrough repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vulnmachine-walkthrough.git
cd vulnmachine-walkthrough

2. Download the Vulnerable Machine

Visit VulnHub and download the vulnerable machine you'd like to walk through (e.g., GoatLinux). Import the machine into your VirtualBox or VMware and start the VM
