Project Overview

The VulnMachine project includes detailed guides for solving vulnerable machines available on VulnHub. Each walkthrough includes information on the tools, techniques, and processes involved in gaining access to the machine, exploiting vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, and cleaning up after a successful compromise.
Prerequisites

Before starting any of the walkthroughs, make sure you have the following setup:

    Virtualization Software: VirtualBox or VMware
    Penetration Testing Distribution: Kali Linux or any similar distribution
    Wordlists for brute-forcing (e.g., /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt in Kali)
    Networking Tools: Nmap, Netcat, Hydra, etc.

## Setup

## 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the VulnMachine Walkthrough repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Midohajhouj/VulnMachine.git


cd VulnMachine

## 2. Download the Vulnerable Machine

Visit VulnHub and download the vulnerable machine you'd like to walk through (e.g., GoatLinux). Import the machine into your VirtualBox or VMware and start the VM

Tools Used

    Nmap: A network scanner for discovering hosts and services.
    Hydra: A brute-force tool for cracking passwords.
    Burp Suite: A web vulnerability scanner and exploitation tool.
    Metasploit: A framework for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.
    Netcat: A network utility for reverse shells and port forwarding.
    Linspect: A script used for privilege escalation enumeration on Linux systems.
